                On The Way helps you find restaurants and more along your travel route. Given
                where you are traveling from and to, On The Way find the top 25 restaurants and
                businesses that are highly rated along the route. The query results include
                summary information about the businesses and direct links to the associated Yelp
                page, as well as travel information, including direct links to Google Maps
                directions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The backend serves a Ruby on Rails API that integrates 3 different APIs:
                Google Maps Directions, Google Maps Distance Matrix, and Yelp Search API.
                Directions API is used for, of course, finding the route information from origin to
                destination, after which Yelp Search API is utilized to look up businesses around
                sample coordinates along the route. Finally, Distance Matrix is used to attain 
                travel information such as duration and distance of each travel, hitting the 
                restaurant as a waypoint. The API is implemented using Ruby Grape gem, and tested
                with RSpec.
              </p>
              <p>
                The frontend is a React JS app that is separately built and deployed from the
                backend. It utilizes Google Maps Javascript API in order to display query results
                on an interactive map, as well as Google Maps Places Autocomplete API to help
                search for places and input them as well formatted addresses. Webpack is utilized
                in the process of bundling the project.

              <p>In Kitchen is a web application that helps you decide what to do with those leftover ingredients in your fridge. You can list ingredients you have, and it will generate a list of dishes with corresponding recipes that include specified ingredients. Each ingredient you type in will turn into a red tag, which you can get rid of by simply clicking the close button. When ready, click "find recipes!" to have a good meal and clean up your fridge. We first parse the user input string into an array of keywords, and use Yumly API to get recipe data. This was a 4-member team project at HackSC '14, and I worked mostly on the UI, parsing inputs, and integrating parsed output of server calls into HTML contents.</p>

              <p>Period Tracker, as the name stuggests, tracks the user's past period dates and analyzes the pattern to perdict the first day of next period cycle. This mobile app helps you stay on top of your, or your significant other's menstruation cycle that can be irregular and confusing at times. The estimated period date helps prepare for the next period cycle, thus allowing the user to focus on more important things without having to keep track of the dates.</p>

              <p>Micromouse is an autonomous maze-solving robot competition. I am currently working with 3 other peers, and we are in charge of the entire design and implementation process. This mouse first explores the maze thoroughly, gathering information about the walls by mainly utilizing IR sensors. Then, with the collected information, it finds a shortest path to the center of the maze. On the hardware level, this involves designing the circuit, mounting and soldering elements, and calibrating sensors. On the software level, we mainly focus on optimizing data structures, bit-level optimization (MCU memory: 64KB), and implementing maze-solving algorithms.</p>

              <p>BugBlast is a maze-based 2D video game. Player can place timer bombs to destroy walls and defeat monsters present in the maze to proceed to the next level with more challenging difficulty. This was a class project in which specifications and basic framework for ticks and graphics were provided. I first organized the class hierarchy following the principles of object-oriented programming, and implemented specifics of each class incrementally from base classes to various derived classes, leveraging inheritance and supporting polymorphism. One of the monster classes had a player-chasing attack mechanism, which I implemnted with a breadth-first search based maze-solving algorithm.</p>

              <p>My partner and I implemented a B+ Tree Index in C++ for a movie database as a class project at UCLA (CS143). It supports loading tuples from input files, select queries on attributes and aggregates with conditions. Insert functions are implemented recursively in order to handle overflows at both leaf and non-leaf levels. It is a generic template that works for any N less than 82 (this limitation arises due to the disk sector size of the simulator we used). It significantly reduced the run-time of queries: for a table of 12,000 tuples, we reduced the disk accesses from 12,000 reads to 5 reads.<br>Then, we built a web app that supports search and update features to mySQL movie database. It is written in PHP. The video above is a demo of the app.</p>

              <p>I have been playing the guitar for about 7 years now. I first started learning electric guitar in middle school so I could play those Led Zeppelin songs I used to love back then. After a few years, I expanded my interest onto acoustic guitars as well. I was in an amateur rock band with 4 friends of mine, and we usually played songs by bands such as Radiohead, Muse, and Green Day. I spent a bit of time learning jamming in blues. I have not been as active in college, mainly due to the living situation and time constraints, but I still very much enjoy permorming music with other people when I can. Some of my favorite bands include Radiohead, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Guns N Roses, and Muse.

              <p>The first time I had fun singing was when I was practicing with my classmates for a choir competition in middle school. After that, I started going to karaoke with my friends pretty often. Since I started learning acoustic guitar, my biggest hobby has been playing guitar and singing together. Many of my favorite tunes to sing are by bands like Travis or Radiohead. I also enjoy writing snippets of my own, so I have been working on a couple of songs for fun.

              <p>Drawing is the oldest hobby of mine. I used to attend an art studio as a little kid, and I spent a lot of time doodling dinosaurs with my dad. In fact, when I first started going to elementary school, I didn't know how to befriend strangers, so I made new friends by drawing them pokemons. As a kid, I was completely obsessed with mythical creatures and monsters, and now I am more interested in portraits and modern artworks.</p>
